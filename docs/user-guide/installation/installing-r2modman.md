# Using r2modman
---

!> For Linux and Steam Deck users, please follow the [Linux instructions](installing-r2modman-linux).

This guide will run you through installing and using [r2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest/) to install and play with mods that are available through [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/). Using a mod manager like r2modman allows you to update and play with the latest versions of the mods with ease as the manager does all of that for you!

## Installing r2modman

?> The latest version of r2modman is **%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b}**.

First things first, download [**r2modman from its GitHub page**](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest/).

For **Windows**, you would want to get [`r2modman-Setup-%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b}.exe`](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/download/v%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b:raw}/r2modman-Setup-%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b:raw}.exe) or [`r2modman-%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b}.exe`](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/download/v%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b:raw}/r2modman-%{thunderstore:f21c391c-0bc5-431d-a233-95323b95e01b:raw}.exe). The former installs the mod manager to your system, while the latter simply runs r2modman without any sort of installation. Simply run the installer or the program in order to open r2modman.

In order to download, simply click the links as shown below and run the program you just downloaded.
